## Foreword

If you see a step below that could be improved (or is outdated), please update the instructions. We rarely go through this process ourselves, so your fresh pair of eyes and your recent experience with it, makes you the best candidate to improve them for other users. Thank you!

## Development

### Prerequisite

1. Make sure you have Node.js version >= 18. We recommend using version 18, the one used in CI and production.

- We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): `nvm install`.

2. Make sure you have [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org) installed.

- On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick`
- On MacOS (with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)): `brew install graphicsmagick`

### Install

We recommend cloning the repository in a folder dedicated to `opencollective` projects.

```
git clone git@github.com:opencollective/opencollective-images.git opencollective/images
cd opencollective/images
npm install
```

## Tests

You can run the tests using `npm test`.
